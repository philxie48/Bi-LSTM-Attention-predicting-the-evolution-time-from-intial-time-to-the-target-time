# LSTM-Transformer-predicting-the-evolution-time-from-intial-time-to-the-target-time
In this work we doing the simulation about the spinodal decomposition, then we doing the PCA to extract the information in the evolution, then using the LSTM-Transformer to fit the neural network about the predicting the evolution
